## About

What is a simple to use app that crosses many disciplines of the modern web developer.

It should be easy to start using based on common ideas
It should implement a system not commonly seen in that particular pattern
It should use modern frameworks and techniques

### What's under the hood

This is a typed React app built in nextjs. It uses Mongodb to store and serve the images and data. It's deployed to production using Vercel

#### Other stuff

React provider for state sharing and useEffect for hooks

nextjs api endpoints

css flex & grid

## Why

After finishing the updated [react tic-tac-toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorial I wanted to greatly extend a simple idea into something more exciting.

Can I build a drawing app?

## History

The first version was a small black and white grid (6x6)

more tools (erase, eyedropper)

more colours

colour picker

canvas that mirrors grid

icons drawn using app itself

api endpoints

ability to save to db

ability to load from db

ability to save as a PNG

ability to overwrite

ability to erase

loader to see available sets

generated thumbnails to db

more meta data to sets

ability to name

## what's next (todo)

graphql layer

AI image API, generate tags, find text

realtime updates? (sockets)

one editor per image or synced updates

authentication

advanced tools

filters

image morphs into new state
